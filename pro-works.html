                <h3>Line-Up!</h3>
                <p class="project-summary">The next programming sample that I will be sharing is the Line-Up! game.
                    Before we started actually coding the website, we had to investigate/decide which popular board game
                    we wanted to base our game off of. My group chose to branch off of Connect 4. We also had to add our
                    own personal twist on the game. My group chose to change the following: Added a points system, added
                    a die/dice for points, made the game more luck-based than strategy. To create our board game we used
                    Visual Studio Code(LiveServer), GitHub, and Netlify. For this project we used the HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript coding languages. During this project, my group ran into many problems along the way. One
                    of those issues being that we had no prior practical experience with JavaScript as we had only used
                    a course to learn before this. However, we were also able to create a product that we were all very
                    proud of. By the end of the project, our game was functional and looked how we had wanted it to.
                    During production, my group employed the Communicate and Reflect Habits of Mind. My group had to
                    communicate with each other to talk about every aspect of production (design choices, bugs, etc.) We
                    also had to Reflect on our past work to determine if there were any bugs or things that we could
                    improve/clean up.</p>

                <h3>Bullying Website</h3>
                <p class="project-summary">The next programming sample that I will be sharing is the Bullying Website.
                    For this project, each student was told to research an issue/problem in their community. I chose
                    bullying (online and offline). I chose to talk about bullying because bullying is a pretty relevant
                    issue in and around my age group/grade. Before we started to code the website, we had to research
                    professional/trustworthy websites and databases that we could use as evidence and statistics for our
                    project. To make this website, I used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Netlify to code/publish the
                    site. I also used Pexels to add images to the site. I ran into many issues during this project. Some
                    of those problems were time-management and coding knowledge. While we were creating this project, I
                    ended up missing multiple days, so I ended up having less time to work on it. I did end up finishing
                    the project and turning it in on time. The two CART Habits of Mind that I employed during this
                    project were Investigate and Persist. Before I started coding, I had to investigate sources to use
                    as evidence in my website. When I was coding, I had to Persist to get it done.</p>

                <h3>DelveHomes</h3>
                <p class="project-summary">One of the programming samples I will be sharing is the DelveHomes project.
                    In this project we had the opportunity to read the short story “The Machine Stops” by E.M. Forster.
                    The goal of this project was to create a convincing website for the (fictional) company DelveHomes
                    in groups of two. During this project, my group used multiple softwares such as Visual Studio Code,
                    GitHub and Netlify. We also used websites such as Dall-E 2, Pexels, and Unsplash for images that we
                    used in our project. During this project, I learned how to utilize coding languages such as HTML and
                    CSS in a practical situation as this was the first time that we had fully used these languages. Some
                    things that my group learned were better design skills as well as better coding skills. We were able
                    to gain more experience using these languages and softwares. Some challenges that we ran into were
                    not being able to decide as a team for what we wanted the layout to look like as well as the color
                    scheme. These both ended up changing multiple times throughout the project. During the production of
                    this website, my group employed two of the CART Habits of Mind. Those being: Collaborate and
                    Communicate. During this project I had to collaborate with my teammate to get our website completed
                    in time. I also had to communicate with my teammate on things such as design choices.</p>

                <h3>Budget Calculator</h3>
                <p class="project-summary">The final programming sample that I will be sharing is the Budget Calculator.
                    For this project, each student was tasked to create a functioning calculator that an average person
                    could use to determine a budget based on their current or future job. This project was the first
                    real time that we had to use JavaScript. We had just completed a course learning about JavaScript so
                    we had some idea of how to use it. Before we started to code the website, we had to review and
                    examine an official EECU budget calculator. We were able to make the design our own but needed it to
                    still be functional. To make this website, I used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Netlify to
                    code/publish the site. I ran into many issues during this project. Some of those problems were
                    time-management and coding knowledge. While we were creating this project, I ended up missing a good
                    amount of school days, which hindered the final product. I did end up finishing the project and
                    turning it in on time, however. The two CART Habits of Mind that I employed during this project were
                    Initiate and Persist. During coding, I had to Initiate/get myself to do the work. When I was coding,
                    I had to Persist to the end to get it done.</p>
