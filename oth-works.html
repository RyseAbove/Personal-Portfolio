                    My first hobby that I will be talking about is the Clovis High Instrumental Music Program. Over the years I have grown very fond of playing music. Since I started playing the cello, seven years ago now, I have learned an incredible amount. I have been able to play/learn in an incredible environment filled with incredible people. I have learned leadership, communication, social skills and through this program. I enjoy playing my instrument because it is fun to create and play music for people. Music is one of my greatest passions in life because it can evoke any type emotion or feeling in a person. Some of my favorite music genres are Metal, Alternative Hip-Hop, and Midwest-Emo. All of these genres can have very emotional, moving lyrics while at the same time not needing you to pay attention to them to enjoy the music. I believe that music is one of the greatest ways for a person to express themselves.

                <h3>Legos</h3>
                <p class="project-summary"> 
                    My next hobby that I will be talking about is building Legos. I have always loved building Legos as I love being able to listen to music and focus on one single thing without distractions. Some of my favorite series of Legos to build are the Star Wars, UCS (Ultimate Collectors Series), and Architecture. I like the Star Wars theme because most of the sets are related to the Star Wars movies and can be familiar for any fans. I enjoy the UCS sets because they are usually much more difficult/complicated to build. They can offer more of a challenge. Similarly, I enjoy the Architecture sets because they also offer more of a challenge compared to normal Lego sets. I also enjoy them because it is cool to see real places in small Lego form. Whenever I go to the store, I will almost always go to the Lego aisle to look even if I don't buy anything.
